API NOTES:
- Create classes for sizing and analysis
- both should have an evaluate method 
- inputs at the Class level:
    - discrete motor parameters
        - pole pairs, phases, etc.
        - power or torque density, A_bar, etc.
    - material models
    - gear ratio
- inputs at the method level:
    - operating variables
        - SIZING: mass, omega
        - ANALYSIS: omega, L, D
    - operating parameters:
        - SIZING: 
        - ANALYSIS: RPM,
